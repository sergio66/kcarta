This directory contains code to produce a compressed database
from tabulated monochromatic absorptions:

absbasis.m   - find a basis B for tabulated monochromatic data

absbcmp.m    - represent monochromatic absorptions wrt basis B

cmprun.m     - driver script takes a list of gasses and vchunks

testchunk.m  - check one chunk of compressed data

testset.m    - driver script to test a list of gasses and vchunks

xsectab25.m  - driver for tabulation of xsec absorptions

testset      - shell script to run testset.m for general checks

testfiles    - shell script to run testset.m for missing files

cmprun       - shell script to run cmprun.m

cmprunx      - shell script to run xsectab25
